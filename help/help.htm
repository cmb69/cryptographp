<h1>Cryptographp_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../cryptographp.png" style="display:block; float:left; margin: -10px 20px 10px 0">
<p>Cryptographp_XH is a
<a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/z_playground:captcha_plugins">CAPTCHA plugin</a>
based on <a href="http://www.captcha.fr/">cryptographp</a>.
It was modified to fit in the CMSimple environment,
can be called multiple times (even on the same page),
and offers an alternative audio CAPTCHA.
It could be used as utility plugin by other plugins, such as
<a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Advancedform_XH">Advancedform_XH</a>,
to deter spambots from successfully submitting forms.</p>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Cryptographp_XH is a utility plugin serving other plugins.
As such it has no usage on it's own.
How it can be used by developers of other plugins is explained in the
<a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/z_playground:captcha_plugins" target="_blank">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a>.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>To successfully submit forms protected by Cryptographp_XH,
the visitor's browser must accept cookies.</p>
<p>The spam protection offered by Cryptographp_XH is not safe against attacts
specifically targeted at it, e.g. OCRing the visual CAPTCHA is not too hard to accomplish.
OTOH even simple text based CAPTCHAs (e.g. the one of CMSimple's built-in mailform)
should suffice to keep out general spam bots. If you're looking for a more
secure CAPTCHA implementation have a look at
<a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Recaptcha_XH">Recaptcha_XH</a>.
The underlying reCAPTCHA is probably one of the best CAPTCHAs currently available.
But even a perfect CAPTCHA can't prevent human spammers from posting spam.</p>

Many thanks to Sylvain Brison for making this nice and quite flexible CAPTCHA
available under a GPL compatible license.
The audio CAPTCHA was inspired by <a href="http://xtc.xhonneux.com/">xtc</a>'s braillecaptcha,
and made possible by <a href="http://www.theblog.ca/mp3-audio-files-alphabet">Peter Keung</a>'s
phantastic mp3 files, which were released as freeware.</p>
<p>The plugin icon is designed by
<a href="http://www.kde-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=InFeRnODeMoN">Pavel InFeRnODeMoN</a>.
Many thanks for releasing this icon under GPL.</p>
<p>This plugin uses free applications icons from <a href="http://www.aha-soft.com/" target="_blank">Aha-Soft</a>.
Many thanks for making these icons freely available.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the community at the <a href="http://www.cmsimpleforum.com">CMSimple forum</a>
for tips, suggestions and testing.
Particulary I want to thank snafu, who pointed me to cryptographp,
and jwndev, who came up with the requirement of having alternative CAPTCHAs for Avanceform_XH.</p>
<p>Last but not least, many thanks to <a href="http://harteg.dk">Peter Harteg</a>
and all developers of <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com">
CMSimple_XH</a> without whom this amazing CMS wouldn't exist.</p>
