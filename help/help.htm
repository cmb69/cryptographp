Many thanks to Sylvain Brison for making this nice and quite flexible CAPTCHA
available under a GPL compatible license.
The audio CAPTCHA was inspired by <a href="http://xtc.xhonneux.com/">johnjdoe</a>'s braillecaptcha,
and made possible by <a href="http://www.theblog.ca/mp3-audio-files-alphabet">Peter Keung</a>'s
phantastic mp3 files, which were released as freeware.</p>
<p>The plugin icon is designed by
<a href="http://www.kde-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=InFeRnODeMoN">Pavel InFeRnODeMoN</a>.
Many thanks for releasing this icon under GPL.</p>

Many thanks for releasing the icons under Apache License Version 2.0.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the community at the <a href="http://www.cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>

Particulary I want to thank snafu, who pointed me to cryptographp,
and oldnema, who contributed the first set of language files for the audio CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>Last but not least, many thanks to <a href="http://harteg.dk/">Peter Harteg</a>
and all developers of <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">
